<h2>Normal Distribution</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        \(\mathscr{N}(x | \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}\)
    </li>
    <li>
        \(\mu\) is the mean, \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation (these are theorems, not definitions)
    </li>
    <li>
        \(\mathscr{N}(\mu, \sigma)\) is a random variable with mean \(\mu\), variance \(\sigma^2\)
    </li>
</ul>
