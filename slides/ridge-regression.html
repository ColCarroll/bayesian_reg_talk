<h2>More priors</h2>
What if we had some <em>prior expectations</em> about the weights of the model?
<ul>
    <li>
        If we expect the weights to all be fairly small, we might write \(\mathbf{w} \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \tau)\),
        where \(\tau\) is a measure of how small we expect the weights to be.
    </li>
    <li>
        We might also write \(\mathbf{w} \sim \text{Laplace}(0, \tau)\),
        where \(\tau\) is again again a scale parameter.
    </li>
</ul>
